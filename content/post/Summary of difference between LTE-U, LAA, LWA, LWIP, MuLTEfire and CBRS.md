This article is written to compare briefly characteristics of six different kinds of LTE technologies using an unlicensed band, primarily for WiFi services. 

<!--more-->

#### Reference Standards 

- LTE-U : 3GPP R12 modification by LTE-U Forum
- LAA / eLAA : 3GPP R13 (LAA) / R14 (eLAA) 
- LWA / eLWA : 3GPP R13 (LWA) / R14 (eLWA) 
- LWIP : 3GPP R13 
- MuLTEfire : 3GPP R13 & R14 modification mainly at the radio layer by MuLTEfire Forum


#### Frequency for Unlicensed Band 

- LTE-U : 5GHz Only  
- LAA / eLAA : 5GHz Only  
- LWA / eLWA : Any WiFi band including 60GHz (802.11ax / WiFi6)  
- LWIP : Any WiFi band including 60GHz 
- MuLTEfire : mainly 5GHz band for data service and sub-1GHz ISM band for a IoT service



#### Serving Nodes Configuration  

- LTE-U : eNB which serve both LTE and unlicensed band
- LAA / eLAA : eNB which serve both LTE and unlicensed band
- LWA / eLWA : eNB serve LTE band + WT serve both unlicensed band and Wifi 

	> *3GPP aims to use existing WiFi AP as their WT (Wireless Terminal), only with a software upgrade to serve both WiFi and LWA/eLWA connectivity. 3GPP already adopted similar concept at their TWAN architecture. eNB does overall management for WTs connected to the eNB.*
- LWIP :  eNB serve LTE band + Commercial WiFi AP/AC + LWIP capable UE

	> *3GPP aims not to touch anything of WiFi AP/AC, touch UE instead. 3GPP already adopted similar concept at their ePDG architecture. eNB does not manage WiFi AP/AC at all, instead, interacts with UE directly.*
- MuLTEfire : MuLTEfire capable eNB and UE

	> *MuLTEfire Forum's intent : Building LTE only with unlicensed bands without the support of a licensed band while keeping interoperability with existing LTE core entities (SGW, PGW, MME, HSS, PCRF and others)*

#### Radio Channel Aggregation

- LTE-U : use CA (carrier aggregation) between LTE and unlicensed band

	> *An eNB have wireless physical layers (RLC & MAC) for both LTE and unlicensed, use LTE band as a primary link (signal+ data) and unlicensed band as a secondary link (data without signal)* 

- LAA / eLAA : use CA between LTE and unlicensed band 

	> *Same as LTE-U. CA is possible* 

- LWA / eLWA : use DC (dual connectivity) between LTE and unlicensed band 

	> An eNB does not have a physical layer for unlicensed band, owned by WT. 
	>
	> DC is designed for these use-cases: when need to aggregate wholly different wireless technologies together; when those different RLC/MACs could not be synchronized - connected through non-ideal path (e.g., because of network/protocol delay)  

- LWIP : use DC between LTE and unlicensed band

	> *Same as LWA/eLWA, Only DC is possible*

- MuLTEfire : Not clear

	> *Both CA and DC could be in scope because MuLTEfire is based on R-13 ~ 14. But MuLTEfire has no anchoring band which should be stable and available at any time which LTE have.*   



More about CA and DC, 

- in CA : Single IP packet can be delivered through **both LTE and unlicensed band** after fragmented at wireless radio layer (RLC layer does this); In an example, if eNB assigns 5Mbps at LTE and 10Mbps at unlicensed band to UE, user can experience 15Mbps high-quality youtube single video stream. 
- in DC : Single IP packet should be delivered through **one of LTE or unlicensed band**; In an example, if eNB assigns 5Mbps at LTE and 10Mbps at unlicensed band to UE, user can experience 5Mbps low-quality or 10Mbps mid-quality youtube video stream and can use remaining bandwidth (10 or 5Mbps) for another application at the same time.

- See [this article](http://www.sharetechnote.com/html/Handbook_LTE_LWA.html) for DC (single PDCP + multiple RLC/MAC); Fig. 2 in the previous article explaining LTE-H also be helpful to how DC works. 



#### Service Direction and Air Frame Format for Unlicensed Band  

- LTE-U : DL Only. use 3GPP Frame Structure Type 1 (FDD) + CSAT  
- LAA / eLAA : DL Only (LAA), DL & UL (eLAA). use 3GPP Frame Structure Type 3 

	> *LTE Frame Structure Type 3 : LTE TDD-like frame format to use a single unlicensed frequency for both uplink and downlink. also, have LBT capability to meet national regulations to use unlicensed band.* 

- LWA / eLWA : DL Only (LWA), DL & UL (eLWA). use 802.11 WiFi frame 

	> *GTP-U tunnel is used between eNB & WT, [Fig.7 in this article](https://www.netmanias.com/en/?m=view&id=reports&no=8532) will be helpful to understand how it works.* 

- LWIP : DL & UL, use 802.11 WiFi frame

	> *IPSec tunnel is used between eNB and UE to transfer user data and signaling. WiFi AP is used only to deliver IPSec packets.*   

- MuLTEfire : DL & UL, use their proprietary frame format

	> *They extend "3GPP frame structure type 3" to use solely the unlicensed band without the help from a licensed band. And also adopt a different kind of modulation method called "RB interlace" to extend coverage instead of SC-FDMA which is used for LTE uplink modulation method for frame structure type 1 to 3.

see 3GPP TS 36.300 chapter 5 for the definition of frame structure type 1 ~ 3. and [this](https://ofinno.com/technology/enhanced-laa/) will also be helpful to understand the differences.  



#### CBRS (Citizen Broadband Radio Service) 

CBRS is sometimes called as one of the unlicensed LTE technologies but has a different purpose. Precisely speaking, LAA ~ LWIP shares and uses an unlicensed band **with other wireless technologies**, mainly WiFi. But CBRS shares a licensed band, called as CBRS band, **with other eNBs owned by another LTE operator**; other wireless technologies such as **WiFi cannot use CBRS band**.

> In 2017, the FCC completed a process to establish rules for commercial use of this band. Commercializing this band enables **Service Providers/Wireless Operators to use it without acquiring frequency licenses**. CBRS frequency spectrum shall help 4G/5G mobile networks deployment quicker and easier. CBRS band is also referred as **3.5 GHz band**.  The main users of the 3.5 GHz band are the US military services: The US Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, Marines and Navy. The US governmentâ€™s intent is to make this band available for commercial flexible wireless broadband use, leading to improved broadband access and performance for consumers. - refer [this article](http://www.techplayon.com/citizens-broadband-radio-service-cbrs-frequency-spectrum-operation-modes-and-its-applications/)



#### Why mobile operators so eager to use unlicensed?

Because... acquiring a licensed frequency band for a LTE service is **very EXPENSIVE**. 

> In a recent example, 5G spectrum auction, 3.5GHz CBRS band and 28GHz mmWave band, at Korea ended on last June 2018. Three major mobile operators in Korea, SKT, KT, LGU+, acquire licenses to use CBRS frequency band, from 3.42GHz to 3.7GHz, 280MHz width, for 10 years after paying a total of 2.77 billion USD (2.99 trillion KRW). Almost **9.9 million USD per 1MHz.**  - refer [this news](http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/search1/2603000000.html?cid=AEN20180618010500320)

- See this [GSA report, Jan. 2018](https://www.sata-sec.net/downloads/GSA/180117-GSA-Unlicensed-spectrum-report-Jan-2018.pdf), which drive me to write this article 

	> *"As of late 2018, all trial and commercial deployments of pre-standards LTE Forum LTE-U technology have been shut down or upgraded to the 3GPP Standard release 13 LTE-LAA" - wikipedia*
